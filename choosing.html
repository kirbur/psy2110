                As a beginner, it is important that you choose the right yarn and needles. 
                Generally it is easier to learn with a thicker yarn and bigger needles so 
                that you can more clearly see what is happening in your work. It is also 
                best to start with a lighter colored yarn. If the yarn is too dark, the 
                shadows will get lost and you won't be able to see what you have done as 
                clearly as if you were using a lighter colored yarn. Just look at these 2 
                knitted swatches:

                <br/>
                In the lighter blue one you can clearly see all of the stitches, but in the navy swatch it all sort of blends together.
