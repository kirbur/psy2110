                The basic construction of a garter stitch scarf starts with the 
                cast on. At this stage you need to decide how wide you want your 
                scarf to be, if you are unsure, then my suggestion would be about 
                8 inches. You should look at your yarn label and determine what 
                the stitch gauge is. You will use this number to determine how 
                many stitches you need to cast on.
