                In this lesson you will learn how to cast on, the knit stitch, 
                and how to bind off. Using only the knit stitch means that 
                the we will be knitting in a pattern called "garter stitch". 
                Garter stitch is one of the most commonly used stitch patterns
                because of its simplicity. You have seen garter stitch on every 
                page of this lesson so far, because it is used as the background. 
                Garter stitch looks exacly the same from the front and the back.
                Here are some more examples:
                <div class="flex marginLeft">
