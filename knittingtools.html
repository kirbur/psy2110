                There are 3 main types of knitting needles. Straight needles 
                are the most commonly depicted needles, if you have seen a 
                movie where someone is shown knitting, you probably saw them 
                holding 2 straight needles. The other 2 most commonly used 
                needles are double pointed needles (DPNs) and circular needles 
                (circs). Both of these types of needles are used for knitting 
                “in the round”. Knitting in the round means knitting in spirals 
                to create a tube, it is most commonly used for hats, socks,
                mittens, and the like. Double pointed needles are used for 
                smaller circumference knitting like socks and mittens. Circular 
                needles can be used for any circumference circular knitting as 
                long as the cord l and needle length is just right. Needles are 
                typically made of 3 different materials: wood, metal, or plastic. 
                The metal needles are typically the slickest and are best for 
                experienced knitters. The plastic are more of a medium slickness. 
                If the wood needles are polished then they are very slick 
                otherwise the are the least slick.

                Any of the 3 types of needles can be used to knit flat pieces, 
                many knitters find it convenient to use circular needles because 
                they are just one piece and can be easier to keep track of.
